HEY! DON'T LOSE THE LOVE

When I called the topic ''Don't lose the love'', what comes to your mind? I could bet you thought I was talking about that handsome bobo or gorgeous sweetheart of yours that you admire so much at the moment! Well, you tried small.

But I have only come to remind you of the God nature called ''LOVE'' that is inside of you.

7 ''Dear friends, let us continue to love one another, for love comes from God. Anyone who loves is a child of God and knows God. 8 ''But anyone who does not love does not know God, for God is love. (1John4:7-8)

A lot of people, scholars, professors, even you, has given a lot of definition to the term ''Love'', everyone is entitled to his or her own definition. But one special thing about love that is undebatable is that Love is a thing of the heart that consumes the mind.That's why Romans5:5 declared that the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts….. You can't have the God kind of love that is deposited abroad in the heart without abiding in God.

2Tim 3:1-5 talks about what is happening now that we are in the last days

* Lovers of self and money
* Unloving/without natural affection
* Lovers of pleasure
* Not loving God

We are at such a time when to love genuinely is difficult. Love is very scarce now, if you are still loving at such a time as this, it is because the love of the Father is still in you.

Do not love this world nor the things it offers you, for when you love the world, you do not have the love of the Father in you. 1Jonhn2:15

My friend, you are at a time when loving God is becoming difficult, this is the last days when love can leave your heart easily and you can be so unloving. If you still have the loving nature, you have got to guard it jealously. Guard your love!

How do you guard your love?You do so by guarding your heart.How do you guard your heart?You renew your mind daily! As a toothpaste is to the toothbrush, so is the mind to the heart….

Galatians2:20 ''My old self has been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me. So I live in this earthly body by trusting in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.

You remember that God is love right? but believe me on this, you have got to be out of your mind, to have the mind of Christ. Meaning, it is not possible for you to love with your own mind, you need the mind of Christ in you for you to be able to love easily and genuinely.

You seriously with a matter of urgency need to operate with the mind of Christ in this present age and time for you to be able to love.

Romans 12:1-2 To renew your mind means changing into new views and feelings that aren’t yours but that of Christ. Words are the food of the mind. The mind feeds on word and produces the current you that we see. To renew your mind, is to change the words/views/feelings that go into your mind daily. You remember that quote that states “You are a product of your mind” It is true. The mind of Christ is needed in you for you to produce true love. It is God’s will that you love because He is love Himself and you need a renewed heart for this. God is interested in your mind. Once again, to guard your love at this present age, you need the mind of Christ. Christian life gives us the advantage of the ability of having the mind of Christ. Having the mind of Christ will reflect in your character.
