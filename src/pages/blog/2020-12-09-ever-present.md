As much as some of us wants to live a coded life or be private, at some point we crave for people to be around us.

Social media tweets had come up with several memes & captions asking questions like; *if you are to be left in one room with just one thing, what would it be?* comment sections had answers like: Food, beautiful lady, movies, laptop, 24/7 data connection, etc  No matter how everyone of us wants to form independent, we really do need the gift of good men and women in our lives. Oh I know how it feels when you look around, checked your contact list and not a single person can be of help to you on a personal-personal ground.

Hello, God is not a man and man will never be God (I know we sons and daughters of God have been declared God according to the scripture) but in this context, I am telling you that you need a good friend that sticks closer than a brother/sibling in your life! And then you need God more!!! An ever-present help is all you need in this your journey through life, because I tell you there are days you will be very weak and you wont be able to strengthen yourself.
Choose that friend wisely and prayerfully, God will do great things through him/her for your destiny.

Have a blessed day.
